This is a benchmark comparing vanilla [Fluidity](http://amcg.ese.ic.ac.uk/fluidity) against Fluidity solving [UFL](https://launchpad.net/ufl) equations using [PyOP2](https://github.com/OP2/PyOP2), vanilla PyOP2 and [DOLFIN](https://launchpad.net/dolfin) for an advection-diffusion problem. It generates runtime and speedup plots with Fluidity as the baseline.
